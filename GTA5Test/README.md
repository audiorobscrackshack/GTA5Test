## GTA5Test

This directory contains the GTA5Test project files.

## Directories
* [**Properties/**](./Properties): Nothing all that interesting here.

## Files
* [**CustomCheats.cs**](./CustomCheats.cs): Contains a WIP implementation of the GTA 5 cheat system.
* [**Extra.cs**](./Extra.cs:) I'm not sure, to be honest. Currently contains a notification substring function, and the DashboardType enum.
* [**Main.cs**](./Main.cs): Main script source. A complete mess at the moment.
* [**prologue1.cs**](./prologue1.cs): Reimplemented features from the `prologue1.ysc` script. Currently  only contains a (broken) version of the "Ludendorff, North Yankton, nine years ago." text. 
* [**NativeInvoker.cs**](./NativeInvoker.cs): See [SHVDN-NativeGen](https://github.com/Sardelka9515/SHVDN-NativeGen).

All of these are a bit of a mess at the moment. <br/>
This wasn't originally planned to be released.
